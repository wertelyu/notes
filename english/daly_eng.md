I guess people feel pressure about the way they look. Nobody's perfect and has some kind of imperfections. Social media tells us what is a beauty and how to standout from others but that doesn't mean it's true. People tend to compare themselves to celebrities and, in order to be like them, begin to notice more and more imperfections in their body.
So what about Olivia - I have to say that our bodies are getting older every single moment and that's ok. Maybe she needs to see a beauticain, maybe not.
