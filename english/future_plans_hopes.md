###

You’ve got nothing to worry about.
I won’t be surprised if she brings it up.
She probably won’t talk about it unless you bring it up yourself.
Anyway, I’ve got to go.

`Fingers crossed!` or `I’ll keep my fingers crossed for you.` - to wish someone good luck.

`If there’s a problem, we’ll text you.`

Use `Present Simple` after `if`.
Use `will` in the main part of the sentence (the part that doesn’t have `if`).

`She won’t talk about it unless you bring it up yourself.`

`Unless` means if (something does) not (happen). For example, `Unless` we hurry, we’ll be late. It’s the same as `If we don’t hurry, we’ll be late.`

Because `unless` means `if not`, you can use `won’t` and `unless` to show how to make something happen.

`She won’t talk to you unless you apologize.`

Only put a `comma` if the sentence starts with the `if-clause`.

`If there’s a problem, we’ll text you.`
`I won’t be surprised if she brings it up.`

I’ll give this book back to you `as soon as` I finish it.

`No will after as soon as and when.`

`Remember to use Present Simple after if, as soon as and when. Use Future Simple in the second part of the sentence.`

I don’t know how to break it to you - я не знаю как тебе объяснить.
I’ll tell you straight up - скажу прямо

`If` you give me a second, `I’ll` find the feedback ... Ah, yes. Let’s have a look.

I think it’s hard for Luke to delegate.

In a bad mood.
In my view. In my perspective. In my opinion
It seems to me that ...
To keep you on track with these aims (цели).
I’ll think about it. I’ll let you know.

`Unless` something happens means if something doesn’t happen, so `you don’t need to make the sentence after unless negative`. In Russian, say если только мы не отменим поездку; in English, say unless we cancel the trip.

When you travel to Scotland, a good umbrella `is a must`.

We have two `options` -  у нас есть два варианта
`option` == вариант
Let's make this special

None of you knew me - никто из вас не знал меняю
well, instead you ruined it. - вместо этого ты все испортил.

Ya wanna? - хочешь?
It's gonna be cool.
I admit it - я признаю это.
It's pretty cool, ah?
I got ya good -> попался, повелся
Hey buddy
Tell me this is a joke
Listen to me - лысынами
in a good way -  в хорошем смысле?

I've got a ton of reading to catch up on.
This is awkward but, ...
Why would you?

I felt like I was never going to understand Lisbon properly!
