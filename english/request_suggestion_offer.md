# go with the flow

A common way to make suggestions in English is:
*Why don't we + verb?*  -> *Why don't we call* Zhenya?
Why don't we go to the police?

When you have an idea:

*How about + verb + ing* -> *How about fixing* it ourselves? 
How about looking for him online? 
*How about + subject + verb* -> *How about we fix* it ourselves?

*How about + pronoun + verb* -> *How about I transfer* you the money there?
How about we go to the bank together?

Could you get some food? I won't have time
Sure. What should I get?

## use *shell* when you want to offer help

Shell I also bring a bottle of wine?

*Shell I + verb* -> *Shell I carry* these bags?
*Would you like me to + verb* -> *Would you like me to carry* these bags?
*Would you like me to call the bank for you?*

*Sounds good* - звучит хорошо 

*I've just adjusted the water meter* 

In American English *just* and *already* are more often used with *Past Simple*.

*It would be* - это будет ...

*I’ve just sent you a message*

*I sent a message to the wrong person by mistake*

*Would you mind transferring the money back?* -> *transfer maney back*

## go with the flow

Go with the flow is to be relaxed in a situation.
*There is nothing you can do about the problem, so just go with the flow.*
