# particular structure that we always make with `becouse + the past perfect'

We often use `past perfect` tense to explain why something happened. The thing in the `past perfect` happens before the other action in time.

I went home `becouse` I `had forgotten` my pasport.
She was tired `becouse` she `hadn't slept` well.
He failed the exam `becouse` he `hadn't studied` enough. 
They were hungry `becouse` they `hadn't had` lunch.
She called us `becouse` she `had missed` the train.
The children were happy becouse they had had an ice cream.
The cooker broke `becouse` workmen `hadn't installed` it properly.
The traffic was bad `becouse` it `had rained` a lot.
She won the race `becouse` she `had trained` so much.
He was upset `becouse` he `had lost` his wallet.
They went to the airport `becouse` they `had left` their luggage.
She took the train `becouse` her car `hadn't broken` down.

`drive drove driven`

I `drove` to the gas station `because` I `hadn't filled` up the tank.

Is that allowed?
