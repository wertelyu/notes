# making telephone calls

1.

Hello. Good morning. `Who is that speaking?`
It's me. I'm so sorry that I made such an early phone call.

`It's nothing`. `Who do you wish to talk to?`
Is Sue in?

Jane wants you on the phone.

I'm atraid I won't attend the meeting this morning. Last night I had a sore throat and I started getting hot.

Don't worry about the meeting. `You'd better` go to see a doctor. I wish you will be well soon.

2.

Can I talk to Mark?
`Hang on`. Let me see if he's here. Sorry, he's not available right now.

Do you have any idea where he is?
Do you know when he will be back?
`He should be back in 30 minutes.`

Can I `leave` a message?
`Hold on for` just a second so I can `grab a pen` and paper.

What can I do for you?
I want to buy something. Do you know where I can get them?

Ok, for now we have three `kind of` attacks.

`Can I have a look at` them?

How many do you want?

I can send my postcards from this post office, right?

Which window should I go to?

What does it contain?
Wait a second.

You forgot to put the return address on the package.
I'll `put it on` right now.

`ffuf` is my `go-to tool`
`go ahead`
`go out`
`pull down`
`it looks really messy `
`literally everything that is connected to the Internet`
`but you can use something else as well`
`come out here`
`come up to`
`i personally would go with nmap if i was going to scan any type of network  or anything like that`
`back and forth` - взад и вперед, туда сюда
`now we're going to move on`
`the way you would do these`
`look for` opened ports
`check for` vulnerabilities
`you have to have an accout`
`I know a lot of people who do this`
`You need to be sure`
`I gotta further analyze` - я должен продолжить анализ
`New CVE is going to be applicable`
лично я выбрал бы nmap если бы собирался сканировать сеть любого типа

Today we're going to be talking about vulnerability management.
I know thart may not be the most sexy topic but I think tha reason that we're all here is that it's exstremely important. 
Many of my clients are still struggling with.
What we can do
What we need to do.

I've been in technology for around 12 years.
We have had the capability to automatically identify vulnerabilities.
