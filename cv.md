# your years of experience in your industry
I'm a Presales-Architect of the Managed Security Services. My mission is to build a multi-level protection against cyber attacks at all levels of the OSI model. I've been working in the field of Cybersecurity for over 10 years. Since then, I've developed a passion to learn something new every day and leverage it in my work.
I have experience in deploying and operating security appliances such as NGFV, WAF, SEG, Vulnerability Scanner (Forinet, CheckPoint, Paloalto, Kaspersky, Qualys, Positive Techlogies).
I've built a vulnerability management process on a previous job using nmap, python, MaxPatrol 8, shodan, etc.
I've found that nothing satisfies me more than solving problems, meeting new people, developing myself, and contributing to business growth.

Feel free to message me — I’d love to chat.
