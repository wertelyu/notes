# top 5 vulnerability Management Failures and best practice

[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE8vrKU7v5s)

1. we don't understand our assets
2. we focus too much on prioritization
3. we only present facts and data
4. we accept too much risk on behalf of the organization
5. we aren't consistent (мы не последовательны)

Analyzing, communicating, and treating vulnerabilities requires context as well:
    
    ownership
    criticality
    operating environment
    relationships

`Treating bulnerabilities` - лечение уязвимостей.

### how to improve

1. leverage APIs to create your own inventory
2. start with VM tool output and supplement (дополнить) or validate with other data sources (начните с выходных данных инструмента VM и дополните или проверьте с помощью других источников данных)
3. leverage tagging in VM tool for contextual data if available

`CMDB` - stands for Configuration Management Database

### Prioritizing vs Problem solving

Now let's move on to prioritization.

1. focuses on treating the most critical symptoms but not the disease (болезнь)
2. need to balance prioritization with root cause analysis

Let's stop focusinf only on vulnerabilities. Let's shift our focus to what are the solutions to these vulnerabilities.What do we need to do to solve groupings of these bulnerabilities. Wjich business units are struggling the most.

Find out what's really happening like this is what you say you're doing are you really doing it.

How is it really going?
Why does it seem like you have a lot of these vulnerabilities becouse of old versions.
We gotta figure out how to patch flash - it was Chrome

And the problems have gone away
Is the Wireshark approved software

The reason!!!

What they are responsible for.

We can `drill down` on something (мы можем углубиться)
`get down into`

### invisible Risk

`obstacles` -  препятсвтия
We gotta overcome all `obstacles` - мы должны преоделеть все препятствия.

### automation

* atomate test and deployment of patches
* leverage infrastructure as code (Terraform) and or configuration as code (Ansimble, Chef, Puppet) if available; if not, leverage scripting, Group Policy

### summry - Best Pracices

* automate the reconciliation of inventory and processes for obtaining contextual data
* don't just prioritize, focus on the bigger picture
* learn to communicate more than just facts and data
* automate everything
